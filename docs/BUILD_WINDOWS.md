# Building and running on Windows

The `Makefile` supports Windows out of the box: it detects the platform and builds
`profanity2.exe`. What it cannot do for you is provide a compiler and the OpenCL
headers/libraries — bare `g++` from `cmd.exe`/Git Bash without them fails with
errors like `CL/cl.h: No such file or directory`. The easiest way to get a complete
toolchain is the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment, which provides `g++`,
`make` and prebuilt OpenCL packages.

## Option A (recommended): MSYS2 / MinGW-w64

### 1. Install MSYS2

Download and install from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/), then open the
**"MSYS2 UCRT64"** shell (not the plain "MSYS2 MSYS" one).

### 2. Install the toolchain and OpenCL packages

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S --needed make mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
                   mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-opencl-headers \
                   mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-opencl-icd
```

- `opencl-headers` provides `CL/cl.h`;
- `opencl-icd` provides the import library for `OpenCL.dll`, the system OpenCL
  loader that dispatches to your GPU driver at runtime.

### 3. Build

From the repository root inside the UCRT64 shell:

```bash
make
```

The `Makefile` detects Windows automatically (via the `OS=Windows_NT` environment
variable) and produces `bin\profanity2.exe`, with the two OpenCL kernels copied
next to it. The MinGW runtimes (`libstdc++`, `libgcc`,
`winpthread`) are linked statically, so the resulting exe is self-contained and
runs outside the MSYS2 shell — only `OpenCL.dll` is loaded dynamically, and that
one ships with your GPU driver.

If you prefer to build without `make`, the equivalent direct command is:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -O2 src/Dispatcher.cpp src/Mode.cpp src/precomp.cpp src/profanity.cpp src/SpeedSample.cpp \
    -static -l:libOpenCL.dll.a -lws2_32 -o bin/profanity2.exe
cp kernels/keccak.cl kernels/profanity.cl bin/
```

(`-l:libOpenCL.dll.a` names the OpenCL import library explicitly because with
`-static` the linker would otherwise skip `.dll.a` files when resolving `-lOpenCL`.)

### 4. Run

Your GPU driver must be installed (NVIDIA and AMD drivers include the OpenCL
runtime on Windows). Then:

```bash
./bin/profanity2.exe --leading 0 -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
```

The executable is statically linked against the MinGW runtimes, so it can be
launched from anywhere (Explorer, `cmd.exe`, PowerShell) — no extra DLLs needed.
If you built with a custom command without `-static` and get missing-DLL errors
outside the MSYS2 shell, either add `-static` or copy `libstdc++-6.dll`,
`libgcc_s_seh-1.dll` and `libwinpthread-1.dll` from `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` next
to the executable.

### 5. Generating the seed public key for `-z`

Windows does not ship `openssl`, and the key-generation one-liners in the
[README](../README.md#getting-public-key-for-mandatory--z-parameter) also need
`xxd` and `sed`, so run them from a Unix-like shell:

- **MSYS2** (same shell you build in): install the missing tools first —

  ```bash
  pacman -S --needed openssl vim   # vim provides xxd
  ```

- **Git Bash** ([Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)): `openssl`,
  `xxd` and `sed` are already bundled, the README commands work as-is.

As always: generate the key locally, never share the private key and never use
online key generators or calculators.

## Option B: linking against a vendor OpenCL SDK

If you prefer not to install the MSYS2 OpenCL packages, any vendor OpenCL SDK
works, e.g. the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
(NVIDIA) or the [OpenCL SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK/releases)
(any vendor). Point the compiler at the SDK's include and library directories:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -O2 \
    -I"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v12.4/include" \
    -L"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v12.4/lib/x64" \
    src/Dispatcher.cpp src/Mode.cpp src/precomp.cpp src/profanity.cpp src/SpeedSample.cpp \
    -lOpenCL -lws2_32 -o bin/profanity2.exe
```

The same works through `make`:

```bash
make CDEFINES='-I"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v12.4/include"' \
     LDFLAGS='-s -L"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v12.4/lib/x64" -lOpenCL -lws2_32'
```

## What about WSL2?

Building under WSL2 works (follow the [Ubuntu instructions](BUILD_UBUNTU.md)), but
**GPU OpenCL devices are generally not available inside WSL2** — the GPU
paravirtualization exposes CUDA/DirectML but not a full OpenCL stack, so
profanity2 will print an empty device list. Build natively with MSYS2 instead.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix | Seen in |
|---|---|---|
| `fatal error: CL/cl.h: No such file or directory` | OpenCL headers not installed / not in include path — see steps above | [#31](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/31), [#27](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/27), [#23](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/23), [#20](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/20) |
| `process_begin: CreateProcess(NULL, uname -s, ...) failed` | You are on an old checkout whose `Makefile` called `uname` on Windows — update to latest `master` | [#26](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/26), [#21](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/21) |
| `cannot find -lOpenCL` | Install `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-opencl-icd` or pass `-L<path to OpenCL.lib/libOpenCL.dll.a>` | |
| Output stops after `Devices:` (empty list) | Install/update your GPU driver; don't run under WSL2 | [#17](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2/issues/17) |
