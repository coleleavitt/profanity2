# Important to know

A previous version of this project has a known critical issue due to a bad source of randomness. The issue enables attackers to recover private key from public key: https://blog.1inch.io/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool

This project "profanity2" was forked from the original project and modified to guarantee **safety by design**. This means source code of this project do not require any audits, but still guarantee safe usage.

Project "profanity2" is not generating key anymore, instead it adjusts user-provided public key until desired vanity address will be discovered. Users provide seed public key in form of 128-symbol hex string with `-z` parameter flag. Resulting private key should be used to be added to seed private key to achieve final private key of the desired vanity address (private keys are just 256-bit numbers). Running "profanity2" can even be outsourced to someone completely unreliable - it is still safe by design.

Note: when upgrading to a new version of profanity2, delete the `cache-opencl.*` files (or pass `--no-cache`) once so the OpenCL program is rebuilt with the new kernel.

## Getting public key for mandatory `-z` parameter

Generate private key and public key via openssl in terminal (remove prefix "04" from public key):
```bash
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -text -noout -outform DER | xxd -p -c 1000 | sed 's/41534e31204f49443a20736563703235366b310a30740201010420/Private Key: /' | sed 's/a00706052b8104000aa144034200/\'$'\nPublic Key: /'
```

Derive public key from existing private key via openssl in terminal (remove prefix "04" from public key):
```bash
$ openssl ec -inform DER -text -noout -in <(cat <(echo -n "302e0201010420") <(echo -n "PRIVATE_KEY_HEX") <(echo -n "a00706052b8104000a") | xxd -r -p) 2>/dev/null | tail -6 | head -5 | sed 's/[ :]//g' | tr -d '\n' && echo
```

## Adding private keys (never use online calculators!)

### Terminal:

Use private keys as 64-symbol hexadecimal string WITHOUT `0x` prefix:
```bash
(echo 'ibase=16;obase=10' && (echo '(PRIVATE_KEY_A + PRIVATE_KEY_B) % FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')) | bc
```

### Python

Use private keys as 64-symbol hexadecimal string WITH `0x` prefix:
```bash
$ python3
>>> "%064x" % ((PRIVATE_KEY_A + PRIVATE_KEY_B) % 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141)
```

### Leading zeros

The combined private key must be used as a **64-symbol** hexadecimal string. Neither `bc` nor Python's `hex()` prints leading zeros, so whenever the sum has fewer than 64 symbols (about 1 chance in 16), pad it with leading zeros. The Python snippet above does this automatically thanks to `"%064x"`. Example:

```
PRIVATE_KEY_A =        0bc657b0af28b743c7f0d49c4de78efd47a5c8923dabfdef051fff5cdc7c30e7
PRIVATE_KEY_B =        0000f8ba428990fca1e618a252ac3614f5de19b20ff00c2ded57bfb6933830aa
sum (63 symbols):       bc7506af1b2484069d6ed3ea093c5123d83e2444d9c0a1cf277bf136fb46191
private key (padded):  0bc7506af1b2484069d6ed3ea093c5123d83e2444d9c0a1cf277bf136fb46191
```

# Building

### macOS

OpenCL ships with the system, so only the Xcode Command Line Tools are needed:

```bash
xcode-select --install   # skip if already installed
make
```

This produces `bin/profanity2.x64`, with the two OpenCL kernels copied next to
it so the directory can be moved elsewhere as is. Works on both Intel and
Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) Macs.

### Ubuntu / Linux

See [docs/BUILD_UBUNTU.md](docs/BUILD_UBUNTU.md). In short:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential opencl-headers ocl-icd-opencl-dev clinfo
make
```

plus the OpenCL runtime (driver) of your GPU vendor — the document covers
NVIDIA/AMD/Intel setup and common errors.

### Windows

See [docs/BUILD_WINDOWS.md](docs/BUILD_WINDOWS.md) — building with MSYS2/MinGW-w64
or against a vendor OpenCL SDK, plus troubleshooting for the most common errors
(`CL/cl.h: No such file or directory`, `CreateProcess(NULL, uname -s, ...) failed`,
empty device list, WSL2 limitations).

### Docker and rented GPUs

A prebuilt image with the OpenCL runtime is available, so nothing has to be installed on the machine that does the searching:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all ghcr.io/1inch/profanity2:latest --matching dead -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

Since the tool only needs your public key, that machine does not have to be yours. See [docs/VASTAI.md](docs/VASTAI.md) for renting a GPU on vast.ai and running the image there with your own parameters.

### Repository layout

```
src/       C++ sources of the host program
kernels/   the OpenCL kernels, keccak.cl and profanity.cl
bin/       what make produces: the binary and a copy of the kernels
build/     object files
docker/    the shipping image and its entrypoint
bench/     tooling that compares the speed of two revisions on one GPU
tests/     correctness tests and a microbenchmark for the mp-math kernels
docs/      build guides for Ubuntu and Windows, and the vast.ai guide
```

`make` copies the kernels into `bin/` because that is the first place the binary
looks for them, so it can be started from any directory. It still falls back to
the working directory, which is where releases before this layout kept them.

# Usage
```
usage: ./profanity2 [OPTIONS]

  Mandatory args:
    -z                      Seed public key to start, add it's private key

```

## Usage examples

All examples below require the mandatory `-z` argument: your seed public key as a 128-symbol
hex string without the `04` prefix (see
[Getting public key for mandatory `-z` parameter](#getting-public-key-for-mandatory--z-parameter)).
In the examples it is abbreviated as `$PUBLIC_KEY`:

```bash
export PUBLIC_KEY="HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG"
```

### Prefix (`--leading`)

Score on addresses starting with as many repetitions of a single hex character as possible.
The score is the number of leading characters, so the tool keeps running and prints better
and better results:

```bash
# 0x00000... (as many leading zeros as possible)
./bin/profanity2.x64 --leading 0 -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# 0xaaaaa... (as many leading "a"s as possible)
./bin/profanity2.x64 --leading a -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Exact pattern (`--matching`)

`--matching` takes a hex pattern up to 40 characters long (the length of an address without `0x`).
Every position that is **not** a valid hex character (conventionally `X`) is a wildcard that
matches anything. The score is the number of matched fixed positions.

**Prefix** — a short pattern is anchored to the beginning of the address:

```bash
# 0xdead...
./bin/profanity2.x64 --matching dead -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

**Suffix** — pad the beginning of a full 40-character pattern with `X` wildcards:

```bash
# 0x...999999
./bin/profanity2.x64 --matching XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX999999 -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

**Prefix and suffix at the same time** — fix both ends, wildcard the middle:

```bash
# 0x1111...2222
./bin/profanity2.x64 --matching 1111XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX2222 -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# 0xbad...bad
./bin/profanity2.x64 --matching badXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXbad -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

**Arbitrary positions** — any mix of fixed characters and wildcards works:

```bash
# 0xXXXXcafeXXXX...XXXX (characters 5-8 are "cafe")
./bin/profanity2.x64 --matching XXXXcafeXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

Note: only results improving the best score so far are printed, so after a result matching
all fixed positions is found nothing better can appear — stop the program with `Ctrl-C`.
Keep in mind that every additional fixed character multiplies the expected search time by 16.

### All exact matches (`-e`, `--exact`)

`--exact` takes the same mask format as `--matching` (up to 40 characters, non-hex characters
are wildcards) but skips the scoring system entirely: it prints **every** address that matches
all fixed positions of the mask and keeps running until stopped with `Ctrl-C`. Use it when you
want to collect several candidate addresses in one run instead of restarting `--matching` for
each one:

```bash
# Every address 0x1337...c0de found, not just the first one
./bin/profanity2.x64 --exact 1337XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXc0de -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Every address with at least five leading zeros
./bin/profanity2.x64 --exact 00000XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

The first matches take longer to appear than with `--matching` (partial matches are not
reported), and a very short mask can produce more matches per GPU round than the result
buffer holds — the program prints a warning with the number of dropped matches if that
happens.

### Character classes anywhere (`--zeros`, `--letters`, `--numbers`)

Score on the total amount of matching characters anywhere in the address:

```bash
# As many "0" characters as possible, e.g. 0x00aa0e050bb03c0b066e00c0f70a03d0d000b0d7
./bin/profanity2.x64 --zeros -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Only letters (a-f), e.g. 0xffcadbfaecfcdeaddeedabadfeedfacebeefcafe
./bin/profanity2.x64 --letters -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Only numbers (0-9), e.g. 0x8896339129744478701529940603494328137361
./bin/profanity2.x64 --numbers -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Ranges (`--leading-range`, `--range`)

Score on characters within a given hex range, set with `-m/--min` and `-M/--max`
(0 is `0`, 15 is `f`):

```bash
# Leading characters in range 0-1, e.g. 0x0110100...
./bin/profanity2.x64 --leading-range -m 0 -M 1 -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Leading characters in range a-c, e.g. 0xcbabacc...
./bin/profanity2.x64 --leading-range -m 10 -M 12 -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Characters in range 0-1 anywhere in the address
./bin/profanity2.x64 --range -m 0 -M 1 -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Other scoring modes (`--mirror`, `--leading-doubles`, `--zero-bytes`)

```bash
# Address mirrored around its center, e.g. 0x...abccba...
./bin/profanity2.x64 --mirror -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Leading pairs of identical characters, e.g. 0x00fFcc55...
./bin/profanity2.x64 --leading-doubles -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# As many zero BYTES (pairs "00" at even positions) as possible; such addresses
# save gas when used in calldata, e.g. 0x00815e00c0fd4a2d00ae00fa00e300ee00fc0034
./bin/profanity2.x64 --zero-bytes -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Vanity contract address (`--contract`)

Add `--contract` to any scoring mode to score the address of the **contract deployed by the
zeroth transaction** of the found account instead of the account address itself:

```bash
# Account whose first deployed contract gets a 0x00000... address
./bin/profanity2.x64 --contract --leading 0 -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Account whose first deployed contract address has the most zero bytes
./bin/profanity2.x64 --contract --zero-bytes -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Benchmark and device control

```bash
# Measure hashrate without any scoring
./bin/profanity2.x64 --benchmark -z $PUBLIC_KEY

# Multiple GPUs are used automatically; skip a device (e.g. an integrated GPU) by index
./bin/profanity2.x64 --leading 0 -s 1 -z $PUBLIC_KEY
```
